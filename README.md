<h1 align="center">Welcome to GNL ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<p>ðŸª¡ Return the next line of given file descriptor every time you call the function</p>

# GNL
Get Next Line Project for ecole42.
Because Reading a Line from a file descriptor is way too tedious.

## Goals:
This Project will allow me to add a very convenient function to my collection.
[libft](https://github.com/LohanGuedes/libft) but will also make me learn Static Variables and how to work with them.

{
	int	fd;

	fd = open("file.txt", O_RDONLY);
	printf("%s", get_next_line(fd)); // this is the first line
	printf("%s", get_next_line(fd)); // this is the second line
	printf("%s", get_next_line(fd)); // how many times you gonna call me?
	close(fd);
